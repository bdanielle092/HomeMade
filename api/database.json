Set aside.\nIn a heavy saucepan, stir together the cream, milk, salt, and the remaining ¼ cup of brown sugar and put the pan over medium-high heat. When the mixture starts to simmer, decrease the heat.\nRemove about ½ cup of the hot cream mixture while constantly whisking the eggs, slowly drizzle the cream into the egg yolks. Repeat with another ½ cup of hot cream, then pour the egg-cream mixture back into the saucepan, whisking as you pour.\nCook the mixture carefully over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it is thickened, about 1-2 more minutes.\nStrain the custard mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean container. Set the container into an ice-water bath (I fill my sink with ice cubes, then adds some water). Stir occasionally, till cool. Remove the container from the ice-water bath, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate\nfor at least 2 hours or overnight.\nWhile the ice cream base cools, make the caramel.\nSet the warm cream by the stove so it's at hand when you need it. Put 2 tablespoons of the sugar in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. When the sugar is melted around the edges and starts turn golden, stir the mixture gently and add another 2 tablespoons sugar to the pan.\nContinue to add the remaining sugar 2 tablespoons at a time, stirring frequently and allowing most of the sugar to melt before you add more. Watch carefully as the sugar darkens, stirring gently to help it melt evenly.\nWhen the bubbling slows down, gently stir in the cream to blend. If you have any hard sugar lumps, just keep the burner on low and cook till sugar melts. Stir in salt and vanilla and allow to cool to room temperature.",

Set a mesh strainer on top of the bowls. Set aside.\n\n3 Temper the egg yolks: Reheat the milk and coffee mixture, on medium heat, until again hot and steamy (not boiling!). In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks together. Slowly pour the heated milk and coffee mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly so that the egg yolks are tempered by the warm milk, but not cooked by it. Scrape the warmed egg yolks back into the saucepan.\n4 Heat egg milk coffee mixture until it thickens: Stir the custard mixture constantly over medium heat with a heatproof, flat-bottomed spatula, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula so that you can run your finger across the coating and have the coating not run. This can take about 10 minutes.\n\n5 Pour the custard through the strainer and stir it into the cream. Press on the coffee beans in the strainer to extract as much of the coffee flavor as possible. Then discard the beans. Mix in the vanilla and finely ground coffee, and stir until cool.\n6 Chill and process in ice cream maker: Chill the mixture thoroughly in the refrigerator, then freeze it in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n",
