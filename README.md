#Capstone Project

Name: Faith Magras

###Overview of Application: 
Homemade is a site design to share your ice cream recipes. I came up with the idea for the site because my husband has been making ice cream this summer. He wanted to be able to share his recipes and learn other techniques from ice cream chefs.  I also added a comment area to be able to give feedback and share ideas.
